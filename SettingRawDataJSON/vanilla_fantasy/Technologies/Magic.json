It is not a force that can be commanded, not in its natural state; it simply is, as gravity is, as time is, as the turning of seasons is. The Pulse rises and falls in cycles that span epochs, concentrates in places of power and thins in places of forgetting, responds to the emotions of living things and the movements of celestial bodies. To sense the Pulse directly is to know the world as it truly is—a living entity, dreaming itself into existence moment by moment, and to know this too clearly is to risk losing oneself in the vastness of that dream.\n\nAll magic in Aethelgard flows from the Pulse, but the Pulse itself is not magic—it is the potential for magic, the raw stuff from which all wonders and horrors are shaped. Mortals cannot use the Pulse directly; it would burn through them as sunlight through a lens, leaving only ash and the memory of fire. Instead, they have learned, over millennia, to channel it through structures that filter and shape its power, making it safe for mortal hands and mortal minds. These structures are the great traditions of magic, each built by different peoples for different purposes, each carrying the strengths and limitations of those who shaped them.\n\n**The Weave: The Arcanist's Framework**\n\nThe Weave is the oldest and most widespread of the magical structures, built by mortal minds over countless generations to harness the Pulse through precision and intellect. It is not a thing that exists in the world but a thing that exists in understanding—a framework of formulae, gestures, and mental disciplines that allow a trained mind to draw upon the Pulse safely and reliably. Those who master the Weave are called arcanists, wizards, mages, and they approach magic as a craft to be learned, a set of principles to be applied, a language to be spoken with perfect grammar.\n\nThe Weave divides magic into schools—evocation for raw force, illusion for deception, transmutation for change, divination for knowing, abjuration for protection, enchantment for influence, necromancy for the boundaries of life and death, conjuration for calling things from elsewhere. Each school represents a different way of shaping the Pulse, and most arcanists specialize, for true mastery of all schools requires lifetimes that only elves possess. The Weave is taught in academies across Aethelgard—the Spire in Argent, the Sun Sages' colleges in Luminas, the High Arcanists' floating citadels in the Sylvanweald, and countless smaller institutions where those with talent learn the discipline they were born with.\n\nThe Weave's great strength is its reliability. A spell cast through the Weave does what it is designed to do, predictably and consistently, as long as the caster follows the proper forms. Its weakness is its rigidity—those who rely on the Weave cannot easily adapt to unexpected situations, cannot invent new effects in the moment, cannot draw upon power beyond what their studies have prepared them for. The Weave rewards preparation, discipline, and the patience to master complexity. It punishes improvisation, intuition, and the arrogance of those who think they can skip the steps.\n\n**The Chorus: The Divine Distribution**\n\nWhere the Weave is built by mortal minds, the Chorus flows from immortal ones. The gods and spirits of Aethelgard act as conduits and filters, drawing upon the Pulse and distributing its power to those who worship them. This is not a transaction in the mortal sense—the gods do not bargain, do not sell their favors, do not respond to prayer as merchants respond to coin. Instead, they simply are what they are, and those who align themselves with a god's nature find that nature flowing through them, shaping reality in accordance with divine will.\n\nClerics, paladins, and devoted followers of the gods channel the Chorus through faith. A cleric of Solaris does not learn spells as an arcanist does; they pray, and the Dawn-Father answers—not always, not predictably, but when the prayer aligns with Solaris's nature and purpose. A paladin of the Green Mother does not study formulae; they live in harmony with the natural world, and when they need to heal a wounded creature or punish one who has poisoned a grove, the power simply comes, as naturally as breath. The Chorus is less reliable than the Weave but more responsive to circumstances, more capable of adapting to needs that the caster could not have anticipated.\n\nThe Chorus also flows from spirits—the lesser divinities of places and things, the dryads and naiads and oreads who inhabit the wild spaces, the ancestral spirits honored by dwarves and halflings and Beast Kin. These spirits cannot grant the range of powers that true gods can, but they are closer to the world, more attentive to those who honor them, and their gifts are often more personal, more tailored to the specific needs of those they favor. A farmer who leaves offerings at the local spring may find their crops blessed with rain at exactly the right moments; a hunter who respects the spirits of the forest may find game always near when they need to eat.\n\n**The Sigil: The Dwarven Deep Magic**\n\nThe dwarves approach magic as they approach all things—as a craft to be mastered, a material to be shaped, a permanence to be achieved. Their Deep Magic, the Sigil, does not cast spells in the manner of the Weave or channel power in the manner of the Chorus. Instead, it captures the Pulse directly, hammering and carving it into physical objects through runes and geomantic alignments that fix magic in place as permanently as stone.\n\nA dwarven rune-sword does not need a wielder who can cast spells; the spell is in the sword itself, inscribed in lines of power that will last as long as the metal holds. A dwarven ward does not require a mage to maintain it; the ward is carved into the very stone of the hold, drawing upon the mountain's own Pulse to protect its inhabitants. Dwarven automata are not animated by spirits or summoned entities but by complex arrangements of runes that give them something like life, something like thought, something that allows them to serve their creators faithfully for millennia.\n\nThe Sigil's great strength is its permanence. A spell cast through the Weave lasts moments or hours, then fades. A rune carved through the Sigil lasts as long as its material lasts, which for dwarven work can mean centuries or longer. Its weakness is its inflexibility—a rune does what it was carved to do, nothing more, nothing less, and cannot adapt to circumstances its creator did not foresee. Dwarves do not see this as weakness; they see it as honesty, as reliability, as the only proper way for magic to behave. A tool that does what it was made to do is a good tool. A tool that changes its behavior based on circumstance is not a tool but a liability.\n\n**The Unraveling: The Shadowed Path**\n\nThe Dusk Elves of the Glimmerdark practice a form of magic that other races find deeply disturbing, for it draws not upon the Pulse in its fullness but upon its absence, upon the spaces between pulses, upon the entropy that awaits all things when the Pulse finally ceases. This is the Unraveling, a tradition that treats magic not as creation but as un-creation, not as shaping but as un-shaping, not as life but as the study of what comes after life.\n\nShadow-weaving, the most visible form of the Unraveling, wraps darkness into cloaks that render the wearer invisible, into blades that cut through light as easily as through flesh, into chains that bind not the body but the will. Psychic intrusion, the most feared form, reaches into minds to read thoughts, implant suggestions, erase memories, or simply watch from within as the victim lives their life unaware they are being observed. Alchemy of decay, the most subtle form, produces potions that age wine to perfection in moments—or age flesh to dust. Necromantic binding, the most reviled form, treats death not as an end but as a transition, a state from which spirits can be called and commanded, bodies can be animated and controlled, and the boundary between living and dead can be blurred until it hardly matters.\n\nThe Unraveling is not inherently evil—its practitioners would argue that understanding decay is as valid as understanding growth, that shadow is as real as light, that death is as natural as birth. But it carries risks that other magical traditions do not. Those who study the Unraveling too deeply find themselves drawn to it, find themselves preferring shadow to light, stillness to motion, silence to sound. They become estranged from the world of the living, from the warmth of ordinary life, from the connections that make existence meaningful. The most powerful practitioners of the Unraveling are also the most isolated, surrounded by servants and subjects but utterly alone, for they have unraveled too much of themselves to ever be whole again.\n\n**The Limits and Dangers of Magic**\n\nAll magic in Aethelgard has limits, and all magic carries dangers. The Pulse is not infinite; overuse in a region can deplete local magic, requiring days or weeks for recovery, and in extreme cases can create dead zones where no magic functions at all. Spellcasters who push beyond their limits risk burnout—temporary exhaustion, permanent reduction in capacity, or in worst cases, death as the Pulse consumes them from within. Those who tamper with forces beyond their understanding risk attracting attention from things that should not be noticed, from entities that dwell in the spaces between pulses, from the Forgotten and the Hungry and the simply curious who find mortal magic as interesting as mortals find ants.\n\nThe greatest danger, the one that haunts every magical tradition and shapes every nation's policies, is the Cataclysm. A century ago, unstable high-arcane and primal magics fused and unleashed, summoning a burning fragment of a celestial body to crash into the continent and creating the Cinderwaste. The Cataclysm did not just scar the land—it temporarily sundered the Pulse itself, causing unpredictable storms of wild energy and leaving a generation of spellcasters inert or mad. The Starfall Accord that followed forbade certain schools of World-Rending magic, established the Order of the Silent Vigil to monitor compliance, and created the anxious peace that still holds today.\n\nEvery mage knows, in their heart, that they could be the one who breaks the world again. Every nation knows that its rivals are researching forbidden magic in secret, pushing against the limits, preparing for the moment when the Accord finally fails. The magic of Aethelgard is a miracle and a curse, a gift and a threat, the source of wonders that enrich life and the source of terrors that could end it. And the Pulse beats on, indifferent, waiting for the next generation of mages to learn what the last generation learned—that power unexamined is danger unrecognized, and that the world's heartbeat is not a thing to be taken for granted."
