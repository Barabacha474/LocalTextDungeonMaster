Suddenly, the old woman speaks up, her voice low and soothing. "Perhaps we have approached this situation with... haste," she says, her eyes darting towards Kael before returning to yours. "We mean you no harm, traveler. Our interest is genuine, but our methods may be... unorthodox."

The Elf woman's gaze flickers towards the old woman, a hint of surprise and curiosity dancing in her sapphire eyes. For an instant, her composure falters, and you catch a glimpse of something like... uncertainty?

As she regains control, her expression smooths out, and she regards you with an unnerving calmness. "Tell us," she says in that same voice that sends shivers down your spine, "what do you know about the disturbance in the Weave? And why do you feel compelled to keep it hidden?"

The air around you seems to grow even heavier with tension as the crowd waits for your next words, their faces aglow with anticipation.

The silence stretches out, heavy with unspoken expectations. It seems to vibrate with tension, like the moment before a storm breaks. And then, without warning, the old woman speaks up again, her voice barely above a whisper.

"We will not harm you," she says, her eyes darting towards Kael before returning to yours. "But we must know more about this disturbance in the Weave. It is... significant." Her gaze lingers on your face, as if searching for something, and then she nods, her expression grave. "We will have to take you into custody, traveler. For your own safety."

The crowd around you seems to hold its collective breath as Kael's eyes narrow, his grip on the dagger hilt tightening further. The Elf woman's sapphire gaze pierces yours once more, and for an instant, you sense a glimmer of... understanding in her expression.
